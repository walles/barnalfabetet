Barnalfabetet is an app to teach children the letters of
the alphabet.

It says for example "K as in key" and presents the user
with three buttons, one marked "K" and two with other
letters. The user then presses "K" and gets rewarded, or
presses something else and gets asked to try again.

Note that the strings are in Swedish, just like my kids.

# TODO
* Have a pref for caps-only or both lowercase and uppercase
* Have a pref for serif vs sans-serif

## DONE
* When this view becomes visible, select a new letter and speak its phrase
* If the user presses the correct button, praise them and pick a new letter
* If the user presses the wrong button, prompt the user to try again
* Pick letters randomly
* Make the buttons and the letters in them as large as the screen permits
